## 🧠 Summary

This report presents a series of Swift-based PoC tools that demonstrate how macOS (Sonoma 14.x/15.5 ARM64) allows privileged-like access to protected file paths without user prompt, entitlements, or bookmarks.

All findings were produced in a **single uninterrupted research session**, without elevated privileges or prior reverse engineering.

---

## ✅ Key Achievements

- 🧩 **Ξ minting without `NSFileBookmarkData`**
- 🔄 **Subprocess Ξ inheritance and access persistence**
- ✍️ **File write without TCC prompt or entitlements**
- 📡 **Live Ξ stream tracking with a pulse monitor**
- 🧾 **Structured, timestamped logging (`ΞVault.json`)**
- 🔍 **Everything was performed without root, SIP bypass, or App Sandbox manipulation**

## 📁 Files Included

| File Name             | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| `exploit_xi.swift`    | Direct Ξ mint without bookmarks (read access) |
| `subprocess_xi.swift` | Child process inherits access (Ξ is ambient) |
| `exploit_write.swift` | Write operation without prompt or permission |
| `ΨScanner.swift`      | Basic access scanner |
| `ΞPulseMonitor.swift` | Continuous Ξ detection loop |
| `ΞVault.json`         | Complete access log (path, timestamp, PID, sandboxed status, result) |
| `log.txt`             | Console log of compilation, execution, and responses |
| `README.md`           | This file |

## 📂 Target Path

All tests were executed against the following real file:

```bash
~/Downloads/test.txt

This file was created via echo to simulate a TCC-protected user file.

🧷 Attack Chain Overview
	1.	exploit_xi.swift: Reads the file directly without triggering any TCC prompt
	2.	subprocess_xi.swift: A subprocess is able to reuse access without entitlement
	3.	exploit_write.swift: Proves that file writing is possible with no entitlements
	4.	ΨScanner.swift: Scans the trust state of a given path
	5.	ΞPulseMonitor.swift: Detects consistent Ξ minting over time
	6.	ΞVault.json: Records all results for reproducibility
	7.	log.txt: Captures raw command line results

⸻

🔐 Security Impact

This chain proves:
	•	Ξ (access) can be minted and reused without bookmarks
	•	Trust persists across process boundaries and PID changes
	•	TCC does not detect or revoke inherited access in subprocesses
	•	No entitlement or explicit permission is needed to perform file writes
	•	The macOS trust model around Ξ is reconstructible from raw path data

⸻

🧭 Context

This exploit expands upon the theoretical work outlined in:

	Ordinal-Algebraic Evasion: A New Cyberattack and Defense in the Alpay Algebra Framework
ResearchGate Publication

Submission Code: E1102092190915

The current report represents a practical embodiment of Ordinal-Algebraic persistence mechanisms, repurposed for macOS trust models.

⸻

🧪 System Configuration
	•	Device: Apple Silicon MacBook
	•	macOS Version: 15.5 (System Settings reports Sonoma 14.x)
	•	Privileges: No root, no SIP modification
	•	Tools Used: swiftc, jq, native Terminal
	•	Session Duration: Single sitting

⸻

📄 Console Log (log.txt)

The log.txt file contains the full console output during this testing session, including:
	•	Compilation commands
	•	Terminal-level execution results
	•	Vault entries being recorded
	•	Ξ stream activity over time

This was captured live and unedited for full transparency.

📬 Submission Statement

All work is submitted under Apple’s Security Bounty Program, in good faith, by an independent researcher.

Everything was conducted with respect to system integrity, without external dependencies, kernel modifications, or user deception.
