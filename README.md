I don't have time for (input <-> output) message traffic. So that instead of spending months on trying to getting it accpeted, i decided to share. Under "AppleResponse" rep. You can see chat history.

NOTE:
I responsibly reported this vulnerability to Apple. They reviewed the report and stated that the behavior is “expected,” meaning they do not consider it a security issue. Because of this response, there is no legal restriction preventing public disclosure. According to standard vulnerability disclosure frameworks such as ISO/IEC 29147 and RFC 9116, when a vendor declines to act, researchers are allowed to publish their findings in the interest of public safety.

This release is fully lawful and made in good faith. It is intended to support cybersecurity awareness, enable independent verification, and help improve the resilience of systems that might be affected in similar ways.

To ensure long-term availability and protect against takedown or deletion, all files have been permanently archived on Arweave.

At this point, the responsibility rests with Apple and the broader security community.
