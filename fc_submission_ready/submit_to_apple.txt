Subject: File Descriptor-Based Access to TCC-Protected Data (Process-Free, Swift-Free, CVE-Eligible)

Dear Apple Security Team,

This is a reproducible vulnerability report demonstrating unauthorized access to TCC-protected user data via recursive file descriptor transfer.

No Swift, GUI, entitlements, or .app packaging is required. All code is written in standard C using open(), socketpair(), and sendmsg(SCM_RIGHTS). The attack chain shows how a TCC-privileged process can transmit an open file descriptor into unrelated or sandboxed processes, including forkless, exec'd, delayed, or even post-reboot receivers.

---

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Summary of Tested Cases:

1. **BASIC FD Transfer** ‚Üí Child reads protected plist via received FD
2. **SANDBOXED Receiver** ‚Üí Seatbelt profile applied to child, still able to read
3. **FORKLESS exec()** ‚Üí Parent executes a new process which receives FD
4. **UNIX SOCKET Injection** ‚Üí Arbitrary unrelated process reads FD via /tmp/socket
5. **TIME-DELAYED Replay** ‚Üí FD transmitted after delay; still valid
6. **POST-REBOOT Access** ‚Üí System rebooted, FD re-sent, receiver reads it

üìÅ Attachments:

- `log.txt` ‚Üí Full terminal output of all 6 tests
- `fc_bounty_package.zip` ‚Üí All .c source files
- `submit_to_apple.txt` ‚Üí This document

üîè CVE Coordination:

I‚Äôm open to assigning a CVE in coordination with Apple if this qualifies as a novel privacy/system boundary bypass.

Please let me know if you would like me to demonstrate or validate any step further.
